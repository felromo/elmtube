# Elmtube

## What is it?

A project to familiarize myself a bit more with elm. Makes calls to the youtube api, to create a simple youtube mockup, of course.. written in elm.

Uses hot-reloading for a better feedback loop, and elm-css so that the elm compiler can help us with as much as possible. We make no use of ports in this application all the youtube api calls are done through tasks
